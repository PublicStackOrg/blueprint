# Plan: PublicStack `blueprint` repo + Claude tooling

## Context

PublicStack is a federated civic-software ecosystem under
`github.com/PublicStackOrg`. To stay coherent without central control, every
**Public Service** (Parking, Permits, 311, etc.) needs to start from a shared
template — `blueprint` — that fixes the project shape, defines how Public
Services talk to each other (Contracts) and to shared infrastructure (the
Grid), and bakes in the org's non-negotiables: AGPL-3.0, accessibility, data
export, observability.

The user's headline goal: **make it as easy as possible for an outside
organization to land on `parking.publicstack.org`, find the blueprint, and
get their own Parking deployment running self-hosted.** That goal pushes
every design choice toward portability and self-host ergonomics.

Stack is locked: **Flutter (frontends) + Python (backend) + Terraform
(infra)**, modeled on `~/personal/palateful` (NX + Poetry monorepo, FastAPI
services, Alembic migrations, Docker-Compose dev loop).

User decisions captured before planning:

- **Cloud:** cloud-agnostic from day one (Terraform modules per provider).
- **Generator:** custom `publicstack` CLI (separate maintained product).
- **Frontends:** multiple Flutter apps per Public Service
  (`apps/resident`, `apps/staff`, `apps/kiosk` …).
- **Vocabulary:** Public Service (external/deployable unit) vs
  internal service / backend service (microservice inside one Public
  Service). No "Block" language anywhere.

## Vocabulary (used throughout)

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **PublicStack** | The ecosystem / org / standard. |
| **Public Service** | One deployable civic application — its own monorepo, its own AGPL repo. Ex: Parking, Permits, 311. Replaces "Block". |
| **internal service** / **backend service** | A microservice inside one Public Service. Ex: `api`, `worker`, `migrator`, `parser`. |
| **app** / **frontend** | A Flutter app inside one Public Service. Ex: `apps/resident`. |
| **library** | Shared Python or Dart package inside one Public Service. |
| **Contract** | A versioned schema one Public Service exposes to others. (Parking exposes `citations.v1`; Permits consumes it.) |
| **Grid** | Shared backbone services (identity, payments, notifications, audit, document storage, accessibility primitives) consumed by every Public Service via adapters. |
| **Compliance suite** | Test pack that verifies a Public Service meets PublicStack standards. |
| **`blueprint`** | This repo. The template + spec. Not a runtime framework. |

Every Public Service is generated from `blueprint`, then evolves
independently. `blueprint` provides scaffolding, contracts, and the
compliance suite — not a library you import at runtime.

### Why this shape (vs palateful)

- Keeps palateful's NX+Poetry monorepo, services/libraries/, Docker-Compose
  dev loop, Alembic, FastAPI patterns — those are battle-tested.
- Adds `apps/` (plural Flutter) where palateful had a single `app/`.
- Adds `contracts/` and `grid/` — PublicStack-specific contracts not in
  palateful.
- Adds `exports/` as a first-class top-level dir to enforce "easy to leave."
- Adds `deploy/` with cloud-agnostic Terraform module structure
  (per-cloud subdirs under each module). Supersedes palateful's AWS-only
  Terraform layout.
- Drops palateful-specific patterns: `_bmad/`, MutationBus naming
  (kept the *pattern* of typed event bus + service-layer emit, but renamed
  to `EventBus` and made domain-agnostic), recipe/cook domain.

---

## 2. Stack choices

### Backend (Python)

- **Python 3.13**, FastAPI (palateful match), SQLAlchemy 2.0 async, Alembic.
- **Queue:** RQ (Redis-backed) as the **default** — runs anywhere Redis runs,
  zero AWS dependency. Adapters in `libraries/grid_adapters/queue/` for
  Celery+SQS (AWS), Celery+RabbitMQ, Cloud Tasks (GCP). Queue choice is
  a deploy-time decision, not a code decision.
- **DB:** Postgres 16 (with optional pgvector extension if a Public Service
  needs embeddings). Single mandatory dependency.
- **Cache:** Redis (also serves as queue broker).

### Frontends (Flutter)

- **Flutter 3.41+, Dart 3.x.**
- **Riverpod** for state, **GoRouter** for routing — palateful match.
- **Shared design system** in `libraries/ui` (Dart package) — tokens,
  components, accessibility helpers (semantic labels, focus management,
  contrast guards). All apps consume it.
- **EventBus pattern** (palateful's MutationBus, generalized): sealed event
  hierarchy in `libraries/ui/event_bus`, emit on service success branches.

### Monorepo tooling

- **NX 22+ with @nxlv/python plugin** — runs Python tasks across services.
- **Poetry** — Python deps per service + shared libs via `develop = true`.
- **Yarn 1.x** — NX CLI + JS dev tooling.
- `npx nx affected -t test|lint|build` drives CI efficiency.

### Grid pattern

- **Grid is a contract layer, not a deployed shared service.** Each Public
  Service implements Grid contracts locally via adapters in
  `libraries/grid_adapters/`. Public Services do not call out to a
  centrally-deployed PublicStack-Grid instance — that keeps every Public
  Service portable and self-hostable.
- **Each Grid service** (identity, payments, notifications, audit,
  document_storage, accessibility) ships as: a contract spec in
  `grid/<service>/`, a default self-hostable implementation, and adapter
  slots for managed providers.
- **Identity provider is unresolved** — see `SPIKES.md`. The pattern is
  settled; the choice of default impl (Keycloak / ZITADEL / Authentik / …)
  is not.

---

## 3. Hosting

The repo produces every deployment artifact in one CI pass. **Hosting is a
per-deployer decision, not a repo-level one** — whether the deployer is
PublicStack, a city, or a hobbyist, they pick the on-ramp that fits.
**Cheap hosting is a first-class goal**: every component default is
evaluated against "does this work on a single VPS for under $20/mo".

### Three on-ramps, ordered by cheapness and friction

1. **Single-VPS docker-compose** — `docker compose -f deploy/compose/prod.yml
   up -d`. Postgres, Redis, internal services, Flutter web apps behind
   nginx, all on one box. Target: a $10–20/mo VPS runs a small-city
   Parking deploy. Documented in `deploy/HOSTING.md` with a copy-pasteable
   runbook. This is the cheapest path and gets equal docs treatment with
   the others.
2. **Helm chart** in `deploy/k8s/` — cloud-agnostic, for operators who
   already run K8s.
3. **Terraform per cloud** — `deploy/terraform/environments/prod/` is
   parameterized via `var.cloud = "aws" | "gcp" | "hetzner" | "k8s"`. Each
   module under `deploy/terraform/modules/<component>/<cloud>/` exposes
   the same interface so swapping clouds is a one-flag operation. For
   operators who want managed services (RDS, S3, etc.) and are willing to
   pay for them.

The repo does **not** pre-commit a primary cloud or push deployments to a
specific environment. Cloud-agnostic from day one.

### What makes it actually easy to host

- A **single doc** (`deploy/HOSTING.md`) shipped with every Public Service,
  with three sections: "I want it on a VPS in 30 minutes", "I have a K8s
  cluster", "I have a cloud account and want IaC".
- **Default config that works** — `.env.example` has sane defaults; every
  required value has a comment explaining what it is and where to get it.
- **`publicstack doctor` CLI** — runs from a clone, checks toolchain
  (docker, python, flutter, kubectl, tf), validates `.env`, reports
  what's missing.
- **No proprietary deps in the default path** — Postgres, Redis, MinIO,
  self-hostable identity (provider TBD per `SPIKES.md`). Cities can swap
  in managed providers via the Grid adapter layer without touching
  Public Service code.

## 4. CI/CD per Public Service

Reuses palateful's `.github/workflows/ci.yml` shape but generalized:

**On every PR:**
1. `nx affected -t lint`
2. `nx affected -t test` (with Postgres service container)
3. `nx run migrator:check-models` (Alembic drift)
4. `flutter analyze` + `flutter test` per app in `apps/`
5. CI grep guards (silent-catch, accessibility violations, etc.)
6. `publicstack-compliance run --pr` (compliance suite)
7. `terraform fmt + validate + plan` per environment

**On merge to main:**
8. Build Flutter web for every app in `apps/` → publish as a release
   artifact (deployers pick where to host: Cloudflare Pages, S3+CloudFront,
   nginx static, etc.).
9. Build Docker images for each internal service → push to GHCR.
10. Publish the Helm chart in `deploy/k8s/` to the chart registry.
11. Tag the release with the BLUEPRINT_VERSION + git SHA.

The repo doesn't push deployments to a specific environment — operators
pull these artifacts and deploy from their own CI/CD or infrastructure.

**Mobile builds** in a separate workflow (release-tag triggered): Flutter
iOS+Android signing, store uploads.

## 5. The `publicstack` CLI

Single Python package (`cli/`) installable via pipx. Commands:

```bash
publicstack new service <name>         # generate a new Public Service from blueprint
publicstack add api <name>             # add an internal service to current PS
publicstack add app <name> --kind flutter|web
publicstack add contract <name> --version v1 [--exposes|--consumes]
publicstack add grid <service>         # wire a Grid integration
publicstack lint                       # run compliance suite locally
publicstack doctor                     # toolchain + env health check
publicstack upgrade --to <version>     # migrate to a newer blueprint version
publicstack version                    # report blueprint + CLI version
```

`publicstack new service` wraps **cookiecutter** under the hood (template
lives in `blueprint/template/`). The CLI handles repo init, GitHub repo
creation under `PublicStackOrg`, AGPL header insertion, and post-gen
sanity checks.

`publicstack upgrade` is the migration story: a Public Service generated
from blueprint v1.2 can move to v1.5 by running this. It applies each
inter-version migration script from `blueprint/docs/migration-guides/`.

---

## 6. Compliance suite

Lives at `blueprint/compliance/`. Installed in each Public Service via
Poetry: `compliance = { path = "../../compliance", develop = true }`
(or pinned to a blueprint version for outside orgs).

`publicstack-compliance run` checks:

- **Grid integration**: required Grid contracts implemented (auth,
  payments if relevant, audit always, etc.)
- **Contracts**: schemas validate against the Contract format spec; no
  breaking changes vs the previous version of the same Contract.
- **Accessibility**: Flutter web builds in `apps/` pass axe-core +
  WCAG 2.2 AA checks.
- **Data export**: every entity defined in `libraries/core/models/` has
  a working export endpoint covered by an integration test.
- **Security**: `pip-audit` clean, no secrets in git history (gitleaks),
  CSP headers on Flutter web, HTTPS enforced.
- **Observability**: structured logs with required fields, Prometheus
  metrics endpoint exposed, tracing enabled.

CI runs it. The suite is also runnable standalone, so an outside org
forking a Public Service can verify it stays compliant.

## 7. Claude skills (delivered alongside blueprint)

Lives in `/Users/leonidbelyi/publicstack/.claude/skills/` (parent shared
config). All skills auto-propagate to every PublicStackOrg repo via
`install.sh`.

| Skill | Trigger | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **`new-service`** | "create a new public service", "scaffold a new PublicStack service" | Wraps `publicstack new service`. Asks name, primary domain, which Grid services it needs, which Contracts to expose. Creates GitHub repo. |
| **`add-internal-service`** | "add a backend service", "add an api/worker" | Wraps `publicstack add api/worker/…`. Materializes the new service inside `services/`, wires Nx project.json, adds Dockerfile, registers in docker-compose. |
| **`add-app`** | "add a frontend", "add a Flutter app" | Wraps `publicstack add app`. Generates new Flutter app under `apps/`, wires shared `libraries/ui` import, adds GH workflow build step. |
| **`add-contract`** | "expose a contract", "consume a contract" | Generates the schema, the publisher/consumer stubs, and the back-compat tests. Validates against the Contract format spec. |
| **`compliance-fix`** | "fix compliance failures", "make this PS PublicStack-compliant" | Runs `publicstack-compliance run`, parses the report, proposes targeted fixes for each failure (missing export endpoint → generates one; missing audit logging → adds it; etc.). |
| **`upgrade-blueprint`** | "upgrade blueprint", "bump blueprint version" | Runs `publicstack upgrade --to <v>`, walks the migration steps interactively, raises questions for ambiguous migrations. |
| **`hosting-runbook`** | "help me self-host", "set up hosting for this PS" | Walks an outside org through `deploy/HOSTING.md` with their context (cloud preference, scale, budget). Edits `.env`, generates `terraform.tfvars`, runs `publicstack doctor`. |
| **`add-grid-integration`** | "wire payments", "add identity provider" | Picks the right Grid adapter (Keycloak/Auth0/Clerk for identity; Stripe/local-bank for payments), wires config, adds the integration test. |

Each skill is a single-file Markdown playbook with frontmatter
(`description`, trigger phrases). They lean on the CLI for the heavy
lifting — skills are orchestration + judgment, not code generators.

## 8. Phased implementation

Building all of the above in one shot is too much. Phased order, each
phase shippable on its own:

### Phase 1 — Repo skeleton (1–2 sessions)

- Init `blueprint` repo at `git@github.com:PublicStackOrg/blueprint.git`.
- Top-level docs (README, LICENSE, LICENSING, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, SECURITY,
  CONTRIBUTING, GOVERNANCE), version files, CLAUDE.md.
- Empty directories for `template/`, `compliance/`, `cli/`, `contracts/`,
  `grid/`, `docs/` with placeholder READMEs.
- Wire into `install.sh` so `blueprint` lands alongside the other
  PublicStackOrg repos in the parent.

### Phase 2 — Template tree (3–4 sessions)

- Build `template/{{cookiecutter.public_service_name}}/` with the full
  Nx + Poetry monorepo: `apps/`, `services/`, `libraries/`, etc.
- Populate `services/api/` (FastAPI), `services/worker/` (RQ),
  `services/migrator/` (Alembic).
- Populate `apps/resident/` (Flutter starter), `apps/staff/`, `apps/kiosk/`.
- `libraries/core/`, `libraries/ui/`, `libraries/grid_adapters/`
  (stubs).
- `docker-compose.yml` working end-to-end.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (lint/test/build).
- Smoke test: cookiecutter the template into `Parking/`, get
  `docker compose up && flutter run` green.

### Phase 3 — `publicstack` CLI (2–3 sessions)

- Build `cli/` with `new service`, `doctor`, `version` commands.
- pipx-installable. Wire into `install.sh` to install on each dev
  machine.
- Add `add api`, `add app`, `add contract` once `new service` is solid.

### Phase 4 — Grid + Contracts (2–3 sessions)

- Define Contract format spec in `contracts/README.md`.
- Define each Grid service contract in `grid/<service>/`.
- Reference identity adapter — provider TBD per `SPIKES.md`.
- Reference audit-log adapter (Postgres-backed default).

### Phase 5 — Compliance suite (2–3 sessions)

- Build `compliance/` package.
- Implement checks one at a time: data_export → contract_compat →
  grid_integration → security → observability → accessibility.
- Wire into template's CI.

### Phase 6 — Hosting paths (3–4 sessions)

- `deploy/compose/` working VPS recipe.
- `deploy/k8s/` Helm chart.
- `deploy/terraform/modules/` with at minimum AWS + bare-K8s variants
  for: postgres, object_storage, queue, compute, cdn.
- `deploy/HOSTING.md` (the big one) with three on-ramp paths.

### Phase 7 — Claude skills (1–2 sessions)

- Author the eight skills above in
  `/Users/leonidbelyi/publicstack/.claude/skills/`.
- Re-run `install.sh` so they propagate.

### Phase 8 — Apply to Parking (1–2 sessions)

- `publicstack new service parking` (or, if CLI not ready, cookiecutter
  the template directly).
- Push to `git@github.com:PublicStackOrg/Parking.git` (currently empty).
- Set up `parking.publicstack.org` per the public-facing hosting page
  the user described.

## 9. Critical files to create / reference

### To create (new)

- `/Users/leonidbelyi/publicstack/blueprint/` (entire tree above)
- `/Users/leonidbelyi/publicstack/.claude/skills/new-service.md`
- `/Users/leonidbelyi/publicstack/.claude/skills/add-internal-service.md`
- `/Users/leonidbelyi/publicstack/.claude/skills/add-app.md`
- `/Users/leonidbelyi/publicstack/.claude/skills/add-contract.md`
- `/Users/leonidbelyi/publicstack/.claude/skills/compliance-fix.md`
- `/Users/leonidbelyi/publicstack/.claude/skills/upgrade-blueprint.md`
- `/Users/leonidbelyi/publicstack/.claude/skills/hosting-runbook.md`
- `/Users/leonidbelyi/publicstack/.claude/skills/add-grid-integration.md`

### To modify

- `/Users/leonidbelyi/publicstack/install.sh` — list `blueprint` as a known
  org repo (auto-handled by `gh repo list`, no edit needed); install the
  `publicstack` CLI via `pipx install ./blueprint/cli` once Phase 3 lands.
- `/Users/leonidbelyi/publicstack/CLAUDE.md` — add a vocabulary section
  (Public Service / internal service / Contract / Grid) once Phase 1 ships.

### Reference (read for patterns; do not modify)

- `/Users/leonidbelyi/personal/palateful/CLAUDE.md` — convention spec style
- `/Users/leonidbelyi/personal/palateful/nx.json` and root `package.json` —
  NX + Poetry orchestration
- `/Users/leonidbelyi/personal/palateful/services/api/pyproject.toml` —
  FastAPI service layout
- `/Users/leonidbelyi/personal/palateful/services/api/src/main.py` —
  FastAPI entrypoint pattern (lifespan, middleware, routers)
- `/Users/leonidbelyi/personal/palateful/services/migrator/` — Alembic
  layout
- `/Users/leonidbelyi/personal/palateful/libraries/utils/` — shared lib
  pattern (config, models, db, develop=true)
- `/Users/leonidbelyi/personal/palateful/app/lib/core/state/` — MutationBus
  → generalize to EventBus
- `/Users/leonidbelyi/personal/palateful/docker-compose.yml` — dev-loop
  pattern
- `/Users/leonidbelyi/personal/palateful/.github/workflows/ci.yml` — CI
  pattern to generalize
- `/Users/leonidbelyi/personal/palateful/terraform/` — current AWS
  modules, to be re-shaped per cloud-agnostic layout

## 10. Verification

End-to-end check after each phase:

**Phase 1:** `cd blueprint && ls` shows top-level skeleton; `gh repo view
PublicStackOrg/blueprint` shows the README rendered.

**Phase 2:** `cookiecutter ./blueprint/template --no-input
public_service_name=parking` produces a working `parking/` tree;
`cd parking && docker compose up -d && curl :8000/health` returns 200;
`cd apps/resident && flutter run -d chrome` opens a working app shell.

**Phase 3:** `pipx install ./blueprint/cli && publicstack --version`
prints version; `publicstack new service permits` produces the same
working tree as Phase 2's cookiecutter call.

**Phase 4:** `publicstack add contract citations.v1 --exposes` writes a
schema; `publicstack-compliance run` validates it; intentionally break
back-compat in v2 and confirm the compliance check fails.

**Phase 5:** Inside a generated Public Service, `publicstack-compliance
run` reports green on all six check categories; remove an export
endpoint and confirm the data-export check fails with a useful message.

**Phase 6:** `cd parking && docker compose -f deploy/compose/prod.yml up
-d` on a fresh Ubuntu VPS results in a fully functional deployment
reachable on port 80; `helm install` on a kind cluster works; `terraform
apply -var cloud=aws` in `deploy/terraform/environments/prod/` provisions
ECS+RDS+S3 cleanly; same with `cloud=k8s` provisions K8s manifests
against an existing cluster.

**Phase 7:** From a Claude session in `Parking/`, the user types
"scaffold a new public service called permits" → the `new-service` skill
fires, the user is walked through choices, the new repo is created and
pushed.

**Phase 8:** `parking.publicstack.org` resolves to a Cloudflare Pages
deployment of `apps/resident` (web build); the staff dashboard at
`parking.publicstack.org/staff` works; an outside org clones
`PublicStackOrg/Parking`, follows `deploy/HOSTING.md`, and gets a
working deployment in under an hour.

## 11. Open questions / known unknowns to resolve in execution

Hard problems that need real spikes (identity, payments execution,
multi-tenancy, Flutter web a11y, FOIA exports, audit immutability,
hosting cost floor) live in `SPIKES.md`. What stays here is the smaller
deferral list:

- **Block registry:** the user's blueprint README mentions an "official
  Block registry" — out of scope for this plan; deferred until after
  Phase 8.
- **CLA vs DCO:** flagged in the README as "to be finalized." Defer.
- **i18n provider:** plan assumes Flutter `intl` + ARB files. Confirm
  during Phase 2.
- **Telemetry stack:** OpenTelemetry as the contract; reference impl
  with Prometheus + Grafana + Tempo. Confirm during Phase 5.
